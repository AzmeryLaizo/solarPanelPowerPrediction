# solarPanelPowerPrediction

As the topic of Climate Change gets wide public attention, generating clean energy has become one of the top policy agendas. Governments across America are incentivizing the public to utilize clean energies, especially in the State of California. Solar panels have been installed in many California homes since solar is the most accessible source of clean energy.
One of the questions that California homeowners ask most is that how many solar panels do they need? Given the wide geographical variation in California, it is hard to generalize one standard for all California homeowners. 
The objective of this project is to help homeowners in Orange County accurately predict the number of panels needed.
